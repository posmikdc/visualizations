## Visualizations

Standing on the Shoulders of Giants! Data visualization has a rich history that can be traced back to visionaries and innovators that changed the world. In particular, I stumbled upon two data visualization that I found really impressive.

First, I replicate Florence Nightingale's Rose Chart. Florence Nightingale was a 19th century nurse and data visualization pioneer. Her work in the Crimean war illustrated that the majority of deaths occurs from non-battle related causes. She revolutionized science beyond just health care!

Second, I replicate Hans Rosling's Human Development Chart. Using time series data, Rosling visualizes the fascinating trajectory of economic development. The visualization is a dynamic one over time and can be found **[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo)**.
