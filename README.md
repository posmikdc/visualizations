# visualizations
Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: I replicate two famous data visualizations. 

First, I replicate Florence Nightingale's Rose Chart. Florence Nightingale was a 19th century nurse and data visualization pioneer. Her work in the Crimean war illustrated that the majority of deaths occurs from non-battle related causes. She revolutionized science beyond just health care.

Second, I replicate Hans Rosling's Human Development Chart. Hans Rosling's work can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo
